In `hedwig`, a Client represents a connection to an external, third-party service, such as `AWS S3` or `Redis`, which you can use in distributed workflows. 

### What Does a Client Do?
Clients enable integration with external resources by allowing specific actions, such as storing, retrieving, or modifying data. For each client, `hedwig` manages connections if necessary, performs rollback actions to maintain a consistent state across services in case of an error.

### Supported Clients
Currently, `hedwig` supports -

#### 1. S3 Client
Allows for object storage operations, such as uploading, copying, and deleting files in AWS S3.

#### 2. Redis Client
Supports key-value operations, such as setting and retrieving values in a Redis store.

Each client can be configured with tailored rollback strategies to control how backups and state recovery are managed, ensuring that the distributed transaction maintains reliability across different services.

### Configuring Clients
Clients are easily configured within the Transaction Manager setup. Each client can be customized with specific settings and rollback strategies suited to the transactionâ€™s needs. For more details, please refer to the wanted client page.
